## Continuous Integration

- This repository is integrated with [**Bitrise**](https://www.bitrise.io) what means that every time that a Code Push, Pull Request or a Tag Push is made the CI will run a build and the tests for this, also when a merge occurs with the master the CI will run the build and the tests.
- The `Bitrise` label at this readme file shows quickly if the master is broken or if everything is fine(tests and build).

## Code Quality

- To keep the code quality I'm using the [**Codebeat**](https://codebeat.co)
- `Codebeat` provides automated code review helping you to easily identify weakness and code smells in your app.
- The `Codebeat` label at this readme file shows the code quality of the app.

## Build Instructions

- Just clone or download the code and run it.
